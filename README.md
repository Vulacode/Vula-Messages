# Vula Messages
This repository contains a collection of messages that were sent over the Vula communication system. This is not a complete list of messages as many were conveyed through other channels (e.g. couriers). Many messages, articles and reports were lost because they were stored on floppy disks. When attempting to extract them many years after Operation Vula ended, a lot of the files were not accessible because the floppy disks were no longer readable.

Most of what you read in these messages will not make sense. Beneath the encryption, codes were used for people, places, actions, organisation, dates, phone numbers and many other things. These codes were changed every six months so there appears to be no continuity in these messages. The codes cannot be made available as many of those involved would not like their names to be made public.

The "year" files you will find here, consist of merged single messages. You will notice attempts to prevent repetitive content that could be used to decipher messages.
