# Vula Messages
This repository contains a collection of messages that were sent over the Vula communication system. This is not a complete list of messages as many were conveyed through other channels (e.g. couriers). Many messages, articles and reports were lost because they were stored on floppy disks. When I attempted to extract the messages many years after Operation Vula ended, many of the files were not accessible because the floppy disks were no longer readable.
